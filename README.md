2. After clicking on the submit button it will break the document(text or pdf) into paragraphs and then index the words. In case of PDF we have to click the "Done" button to extract the text.
3. After uploading and submitting we can go to the "Search" tab and then select the word which we choose to find.
4. After that we will get the list of all paragraphs where we can find the words. This list consists of the paragraphs parsed from the pdf files also.
